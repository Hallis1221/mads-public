Want to learn about the pipeline for advertisements and content? This blog post is the most useful if you are either looking into becoming a mads creator - or advertiser - or already is one.

#### **Community creator signs up.**

It all starts with a community creator signing up for - and getting accepted - into the mads creator program. We set a high bar for who we let in. This ensures that both the community creator and the marketplace creator creates family-friendly content.

#### **Marketplace creator signs up.**

A marketplace creator reaches out to the mads team. Either through the form on the website, Twitter or discord. In either case, they have to verify that they are actually representing a Minecraft marketplace partner team. If verified - and accepted - they will gain access to a mads dashboard account with advertiser permissions.

#### **An ad is submitted for review.**

A mads account with advertiser permissions submits an ad for review. A mads admin reviews the advertisement. The ad has a few properties. These properties are decided by the advertiser upon submission. The ad is ready once both an upfront payment has been made and the ad is accepted.
